[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/loryanstrant/HA-ElevenLabs-Custom-TTS.svg)](https://github.com/loryanstrant/HA-ElevenLabs-Custom-TTS/releases/)

An ElevenLabs TTS integration for Home Assistant that allows for custom options to be passed in actions, not just the integration settings.

This custom component provides two main services:
1. **Get Voices** - Retrieve all available voices from ElevenLabs API
2. **Generate Voice** - Generate speech with full control over parameters

## âœ¨ New Features

### Enhanced Voice Discovery
- **Voice Type Filtering**: Filter voices by category (premade, cloned, generated, professional)
- **Voice Search**: Search voices by name, description, or labels (e.g., "british", "male", "authoritative")
- **Smart Voice Selection**: Use filters in automations to dynamically select the perfect voice

### Direct Media Player Integration
- **Instant Playback**: Send TTS audio directly to media player entities without file system
- **Multi-Room Audio**: Easily broadcast announcements to multiple speakers
- **Streamlined Workflow**: No need to manage temporary files or complex automation chains

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing automations continue to work unchanged
- File output and base64 encoding still fully supported
- Gradual migration path to new features

## Installation

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance

## Usage

### Get Voices Service

Retrieves all available voices from your ElevenLabs account with optional filtering:

```yaml
# Get all voices
service: elevenlabs_custom_tts.get_voices

# Filter by voice type
service: elevenlabs_custom_tts.get_voices
data:
  voice_type: "premade"  # Options: premade, cloned, generated, professional

# Search for voices
service: elevenlabs_custom_tts.get_voices
data:
  search_text: "british"  # Search by name, description, or labels

# Combined filtering
service: elevenlabs_custom_tts.get_voices
data:
  voice_type: "premade"
  search_text: "male"
```

This returns a list of voices with their IDs, names, categories, and other metadata.

### Generate Voice Service

Generate speech with custom parameters:

```yaml
service: elevenlabs_custom_tts.generate_voice
data:
  text: "Hello, this is a test message."
  voice_id: "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM"  # Required
  model_id: "eleven_multilingual_v2"  # Optional, default: eleven_multilingual_v2
