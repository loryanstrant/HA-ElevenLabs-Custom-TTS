# Get all voices
service: elevenlabs_custom_tts.get_voices

# Filter by voice type
service: elevenlabs_custom_tts.get_voices
data:
  voice_type: "premade"  # Options: premade, cloned, generated, professional

# Search for voices
service: elevenlabs_custom_tts.get_voices
data:
  search_text: "british"  # Search by name, description, or labels

# Combined filtering
service: elevenlabs_custom_tts.get_voices
data:
  voice_type: "premade"

This returns a list of voices with their IDs, names, categories, and other metadata.
